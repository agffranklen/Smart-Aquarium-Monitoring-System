# Smart-Aquarium-Monitoring-System
 Manually tested a pH sensor and DS18B20 temperature sensor for a Smart Aquarium Monitoring System without using a microcontroller. I measured voltage outputs, applied calibration formulas, and calculated pH and temperature values manually, ensuring accurate readings for real-time water quality analysis.
